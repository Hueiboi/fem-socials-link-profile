## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

What I learned was how to align the layout and elements inside the card correctly and properly.

```css
.profile__socials {
      font-size: 14px;
      list-style: none;
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      align-items: center;
      gap: 16px;
      width: 100%;
    }

    .socials__item {
      font-size: 14px;
      font-weight: 700;
      width: 100%;
      text-align: center;
      padding: 12px;
      background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 20%);
      min-width: 275px;
      border-radius: 10px;
    }
```

### Continued development

I would like to be able to practice more flexible layout alignment and layout like grid in future projects.
